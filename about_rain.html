   <p class="left-align"> In the summer of 2023, huge rainfalls flooded the area of Thessaly in Greece. The amount of water reached 1096 millimeters, a huge, number according to scientists, and one of the deadliest in the country's history. <br><br> In this artwork, words flood the screen in the same way water entered into the houses, keeping whole villages underwater for many days. Many people  and animals drowned during this disaster. The words, made up of AI randomly generated abstracts of news and journalistic material relating to this event, are entering the screen slowly and the water level is rising until they flood the whole page, simulating  the emotions of a helpless inhabitant  who experiences loss as his whole house is sinking into mud.
