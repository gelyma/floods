   <p class="left-align"> During the devastating floods that took place in Thessaly, Greece in the summer of 2023,  enormous amounts of rain have led to a postapocalyptic disaster destroying cities and landscapes like rarely never before in European history. Many people have drowned and innumerable houses, roads and railways were buried under tones of mud. Agricultural land has suffered the most as whole fertile regions have been swept away by the rushing waters and completely destroyed. According to scientists, it will take hundreds of years to rebuild the fertile topsoil - one centimeter of soil can take 100 years to be reborn. Landscapes might never come back to the state they have been a few years ago. 
<br><br>This work is deliberately bringing the user face to face with the imprints of an environmental disaster and the irreversible natural forces that form our lives in the middle of a global climate crisis. Thus, this work is a contradictory website. The artwork is calling the user to stop for a minute, to pause, watch and reflect on the idea of a crisis, while earth is struggling to rebuild ten millimeters of topsoil again.
