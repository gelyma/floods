# floods
The project presents a diptych consisting of two short artworks reflecting on the aftermath of the devastating floods that took place in central Greece in the summer of 2023, following 'Daniel' storms. The works are set in dialogue with each other while also making use of the media to raise awareness of the climate crisis. They also act as a short online ‘memorial’, part poetic, part journalistic, of a recent social trauma. Instead of making fast actions and interactions, the user is asked to pause, watch and reflect on the power and processes of natural phenomena in contrast to the scale and pace of human civilization.
